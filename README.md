Soil
Soil is a 2D farming simulation game built with C++ and the iGraphics library. Step into the boots of a farmer, cultivate crops, raise animals, and sell your goods at the market to grow your farm into a thriving enterprise.

üåü Features
Dynamic Menu System: A fully interactive main menu with options to start a new game, view high scores, and quit.

Two Explorable Maps: Travel between your home farm and the bustling town market via a ship.

Farming Mechanics: Plant seeds, watch your crops grow through multiple stages, and harvest them for food.

Upgradable Farm: Purchase a special crop bed for faster growth and hire a worker to help on your farm.

Animal Husbandry: Animated cows roam your farm, and you can collect milk to sell.

In-Game Economy: Manage your money to buy seeds and upgrades. Sell food and milk at the market to earn more.

Arcade Mini-Game: Take a break from farming and test your reflexes with a fun color-matching mini-game at the market.

Persistent Leaderboard: Your score (total money) is saved to a file, and the top 5 scores are displayed on the leaderboard.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
This project is built using the iGraphics library, which is a wrapper for OpenGL GLUT.

Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (like g++).

A development environment configured to work with iGraphics.h and GLUT (e.g., Code::Blocks).

The required DLL files for GLUT must be accessible by the executable.

Running the Game
Clone the repository or download the source files.

Set up the project folder structure as follows:

/YourProjectFolder
|-- main.cpp
|-- menu.hpp
|-- elements.hpp
|-- movement.hpp
|-- scores.txt      (will be created automatically)
|-- /img/           (Contains all .bmp and .png image assets)
|-- /Audios/        (Contains all .mp3 audio files)


Compile the main.cpp file with your C++ compiler, linking the necessary graphics libraries (-lopengl32 -lfreeglut -lglu32 -lgdi32).

Run the generated executable.

üìÇ File Structure
main.cpp: The main entry point of the game. Handles the game loop, drawing logic, and event handling.

menu.hpp: Manages the main menu, leaderboard display, and related user interactions.
